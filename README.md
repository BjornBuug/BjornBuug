<h1>Hi üëã My name is Ouail, also known as BjornBug </h1>

üë®üèª‚Äçüíª **About Me:**

I'm a **Smart contract Developer** based in üá∏üá™ Sweden. I have 2 years of experience as a **full-stack blockchain developer** and 2 years of experience as a **front-end developer**. I specialize in:

- EVM-based technologies
- Smart contract development
- Unit testing
- Security reviews

I have professional experience working on various Web3 projects, including oracles integrations (Chainlink, Pyth Network), as well as AMMs, perpetual futures, lending and borrowing protocols, I've also reviewed multiple DeFi protocols through private audits and public contests on **Code4rena, Sherlock, and CodeHawk**.

A year ago, I decided to move away from full-stack blockchain development to specialize in developing and reviewing complex DeFi protocols. I'm now focusing exclusively on DeFi, aiming to expand my knowledge in this exciting and innovative field.

I'm actively looking for new opportunities in the DeFi space to continue growing and developing my skills.

Feel free to connect and DM me for opportunities on [X](https://x.com/Bjorn_Bug), or reach out via Gmail: ouailtbytes@gmail.com even for simple questions :)
